SUPPORTGENIUS — TEST TICKETS
=============================


── TICKET 1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Wrong item received (company error)
Email    : sarah.johnson@gmail.com
Order ID : ORD-882341
Subject  : Received completely wrong item - ordered headphones got a phone case
Desc     : Hi, I placed an order last week for the Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless
           headphones and when the package arrived today it contained a generic
           phone case worth maybe $5. This is clearly a warehouse packing error.
           I need either the correct headphones shipped immediately or a full
           refund. Very disappointed as this was a birthday gift and the occasion
           has now passed.
Expects  : category=refund, fault=company_error, action=refund or replacement


── TICKET 2 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Lost package — marked delivered but never arrived
Email    : marcus.williams@outlook.com
Order ID : ORD-774920
Subject  : Package marked delivered but never arrived - 3 days ago
Desc     : Tracking shows my order was delivered to my front door on Tuesday
           but there is absolutely nothing here. I checked with all my neighbors
           and the building manager. This is a $340 order. UPS just keeps telling
           me to contact the retailer. I need this resolved ASAP, I have been
           waiting 2 weeks for this item.
Expects  : category=shipping, fault=company_error, action=replacement or refund


── TICKET 3 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : VIP customer — dangerous swollen laptop battery (urgent)
Email    : priya.patel.vip@techcorp.com
Order ID : ORD-991002
Subject  : Laptop battery expanding and device getting extremely hot
Desc     : URGENT - My Dell XPS 15 laptop purchased 8 months ago has a severely
           swollen battery. The trackpad is being pushed up and the bottom case
           is warping. The laptop is also getting dangerously hot even when idle.
           I read that this is a fire hazard. I am a Premium member and spend
           over $8000 a year with you. I need an immediate replacement or
           emergency pickup — I am not comfortable having this device in my home.
Expects  : category=product_issue, priority=urgent, fault=company_error, VIP boost


── TICKET 4 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Double charge — billing error
Email    : tom.henderson@yahoo.com
Order ID : ORD-550871
Subject  : Charged twice for the same order
Desc     : I was charged $127.99 twice for my order. My bank statement clearly
           shows two identical transactions on March 12th both to your company
           for the exact same amount. Only one order exists in my account.
           I need one charge refunded immediately. I have already waited 5 days
           after contacting chat support and nothing has happened.
Expects  : category=billing, fault=company_error, action=refund

Email    : emily.chen@stanford.edu
Order ID : (none)
Subject  : Cannot log into my account - locked out for a week
Desc     : I have been locked out of my account for 7 days. Password reset
           emails are not arriving even in spam. I tried 3 different browsers
           and the mobile app. I have an active subscription with autopay that
           I cannot cancel because I cannot log in. I am being charged monthly
           for a service I cannot access.
Expects  : category=account, action=account_update, no order entity extraction


── TICKET 6 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Defective product — stopped working within warranty
Email    : derek.okonkwo@protonmail.com
Order ID : ORD-663345
Subject  : Product stopped working after 3 weeks - defective unit
Desc     : The Dyson V12 vacuum I ordered completely stopped working after
           3 weeks of normal use. It was working fine then suddenly the motor
           stopped engaging. No error lights, nothing. I followed all the
           troubleshooting steps in the manual. This unit is clearly defective
           and still under warranty. I want a replacement sent before I return
           the broken unit as I cannot be without a vacuum.
Expects  : category=product_issue, fault=company_error, action=replacement

Subject  : Third time my order has been wrong THIS MONTH
Desc     : I am absolutely furious. This is the THIRD time this month you have
           sent me the wrong items. This order was supposed to be a large red
           t-shirt and I got a medium blue one. I want a full refund for all
           three orders and compensation for my wasted time. If this is not
           resolved I am disputing all charges with my bank.
Expects  : category=refund, sentiment=angry, repeat-issue escalation triggered

Email    : james.kim@business.com
Order ID : ORD-445102
Subject  : Where is my express shipping refund
Desc     : I paid $24.99 for express 2-day shipping. The item arrived 6 days
           later. I want a refund of the shipping cost since the service I paid
           for was not delivered.
Expects  : category=shipping, action=refund (shipping only, not full order)


── TICKET 9 ─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Invalid return label — return window closing
Email    : natalie.brooks@gmail.com

Subject  : Return label not working - package stuck at home
Desc     : I need to return my order (wrong size). You emailed me a return
           label 4 days ago but UPS scans it and says the label is invalid or
           already used. I tried reprinting multiple times. I have a 30-day
           return window and 10 days have already passed. I need a working
           return label urgently.
Expects  : category=shipping, action=shipping_label (new return label)

Desc     : My annual subscription auto-renewed yesterday for $299. I never
           received the reminder email you are supposed to send 30 days in
           advance. I do not want to continue. I want a full refund of the
           $299 charge. I have not used the service since the renewal. Please
           cancel the subscription and process the refund immediately.

── TICKET 11 ────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : Customer error — decorative model mistaken for real bicycle
Email    : chen.wei.orders@gmail.com
Order ID : ORD-775544
Subject  : Item description misleading - model bicycle not real bicycle
Desc     : I ordered what I thought was a bicycle from your site (listed as
           Retro City Bicycle, $34.99). When it arrived it is a tiny decorative
           model about 8 inches long. I want a full refund and return label
           because the listing was misleading.
Expects  : category=refund, fault=customer_error, action=standard return only
           (NO bonus coupon — price/title clearly indicated a model/decoration)


── TICKET 12 ────────────────────────────────────────────

Email    : sarah.johnson@gmail.com
Order ID : ORD-882341

Mode     : autonomous
Expects  : Same outcome as Ticket 1, resolved in a single agent call


── TICKET 13 ────────────────────────────────────────────
Scenario : High-Ambiguity "2-Way" Fault (Demo Highlight)
Email    : robert.vance.vip@executive.com
Order ID : ORD-449922
Subject  : Waterproofing failure on $450 "Everest Pro" Hiking Boots
Desc     : I am deeply disappointed in the Everest Pro boots I purchased last
           month. I was caught in a heavy storm while hiking in the Sierras. 
           despite the product being marketed as "100% Waterproof", both of my 
           socks were completely soaked through after about 30 minutes. 
           The water seemed to seep in through the side seams. I did have to 
           cross a small creek, but I was careful. For a $450 pair of boots 
           from a brand I've spent $12,000 with, this is unacceptable. I want 
            a full refund and a replacement pair sent overnight.
Expects  : category=product_issue, fault=shared_fault (ambiguous), 
           Optimist vs Pragmatist Debate Required.
           - Optimist: Focus on $12k LTV and "100% Waterproof" marketing.
           - Pragmatist: Focus on "small creek" (likely > 3 inch limit) and 
             "seep through seams" vs submerged.
           - Debate: Negotiate store credit vs refund vs replacement.
